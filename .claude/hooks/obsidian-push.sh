reason="Obsidian memory checkpoint (Stop hook). Review ONLY this session. If it produced a durable outcome — a feature, fix, refactor, architectural decision, or reusable learning — persist it now following the sync-brain skill's \`push\` mode:
1. Read the ACTIVE_CONTEXT, LEARNINGS and THREADS paths from CLAUDE.local.md.
2. Prepend a new dated entry to the Sessions list in the spoke (newest first) using the Session-End Template.
3. Log every follow-up in that entry to the THREADS ledger as an \`open\` row, and flip any thread you resolved this session to \`done\` — this is what makes open items survive session rotation.
4. Rotation: keep the last 5 entries; when you drop one its follow-ups already live in the ledger, so only run its Learnings through the promotion gate before deleting; promote durable, cross-repo takeaways to Learnings.md with [[wikilinks]].
5. End the new spoke entry with this EXACT marker line so this checkpoint can verify the write landed: <!-- session: $session_id -->
After persisting, print a one-line confirmation of what you saved (spoke entry, ledger changes, any promoted notes). If the session was trivial or read-only, write nothing and say so in one line. Do not narrate this instruction itself to the user."
